  <item>DAYS &amp; SCHEDULE: The app displays ongoing events with a green background,
    future events yellow, and ended events gray. Start scrolling to view a scrollbar
    on the right side of the page, then quickly jump to any day. Select a day
	 to expand or collapse every hour for that day and view your schedule for
	 each hour.
    Touch the star to the left of an event to add it to "My Events"
    list at the top of each day and the "Starred" tab to the left.
    View your events, event notes and tournament finishes
    by clicking on the "My Data" tab or swiping to the right from the Schedule tab.
	\n\nMY DATA:  This screen shows events you have clicked on or starred, related
	 notes, and	tournament finishes (you may save 1 finish per game, NOT per
	 heat/round).  To clear a note, click on the note entry then click on Clear at
	 lower left.  To clear a finish, click on either the event or the finish entry
	 and set the finish to 0.  To remove all your events, click Delete All at bottom.
	 Note - Delete all removes Events only, not finishes or notes.  Those must be
	 removed separately.
    \n\nSEARCHING: The magnifier icon shows a list of all games and allows you to
	  either select a specific game or type in search words.  You can
	  search for and select a tournament to view and/or star all of its events.
    For example, to find every Power Grid event, type "Power"
    and select "Power Grid" from the list, or type "Power Grid" and hit search. Or to
    view every demo event in the convention, type "Demo" and hit search. If you want to
    view all the tournaments and filter down the list to your favorites,
    use "Filter Schedule" from the main menu.
    \n\nSAVING: App settings, tournament finishes, event notes, etc.
    are all saved automatically, so do not worry about losing your settings!
    \n\nPlease contact dev@boardgamers.org with any further questions.
  </item>
		<item>The schedule on the main screen is a chronological
    listing of events by order of appearance.  Events are listed
	in alphabetical order.  Junior Events are highlighted by a
    symbol and are in green. Demonstrations are listed in black italics.
    Advanced rounds that require prior qualification,
    such as Finals, are listed in red.
  </item>
		<item>Abbreviations for dates are Mo:
    Monday, Tu: Tuesday, We: Wednesday,
    Th: Thursday, Fr: Friday, Sa: Saturday, Su:
    Sunday, SMo: Second Monday.  "SMo" indicates
    that events occur on the Monday after WBC ends.
  </item>
		<item>Times are listed in military time;
    e.g., 11 or 1100 is 11 am and 13 or 1300 is 1 pm. Tournament
    play commences at the scheduled times for
    each event and may run past midnight. No
    event may start a round after midnight (exception:
    our five night enders) or reconvene
    before 9 am without the consent of all remaining
    players.
  </item>
		<item>“H1/3” indicates the
    heat number out of the total number of
    heats. “R1/6” indicates the round number
    out of the estimated total number of rounds.
    A “-” instead of a “/” in the Round listing
    indicates that the rounds are continuous,
    starting immediately after the end of
    the preceding round. Heats are multiple
    starts of an event’s preliminary (qualifying)
    round. Players may play in as many heats as
    they wish, win or lose. Rounds often require
    players to qualify to advance to the next
    round. Players wishing to withdraw even
    if they qualify for the next round should
    inform the GM. Players who wish to enter
    an event in an advanced round must have
    the permission of the GM.
  </item>
		<item>Play is restricted
    to players who have qualified for these
    rounds. For “SF/F,” the Final immediately follows
    the semifinal. Final rounds may be rescheduled
    by the GM for the mutual benefit
    of the finalists. Such rescheduling requires the
    agreement of ALL remaining players without
    pressure to do so, otherwise the scheduled
    time is the default. Those who can’t abide by
    it must forfeit. Players who fail to appear for
    advanced rounds forfeit any claim on prizes
    or laurels that pass instead to those who advance
    in their place.
  </item>
		<item>1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 is the number
    of places receiving plaques; 2 through 6 are
    Century events.
  </item>
		<item>There are three classes of tournaments:
    \n\nA: Advanced; Experienced players only. Rules will not
			be explained. Neither GMs nor players will teach
			the game to beginners during the event.;
    \n\nB: Beginners welcome, Players must have read the rules,
			played previously, or participated in a scheduled
			teaching demonstration. For subsequent rounds,
			the Class is A;
    \n\nC: Coached, inexperienced players welcome. The game
			will be taught to anyone present at the scheduled
			starting time. GMs may also schedule a demonstration
			for the Event.  Once past the Preliminary round, the
			Class is always A.
  </item>
		<item>All teaching sessions take
    place in the Exhibit Hall Annex at the listed Table
    #. For B Class Events, anyone new to a game
    must attend. For C Class Event s, attending a
    scheduled demo places less stress on the GM
    and the event. If no one arrives for a demo
    within 15 minutes of the scheduled starting
    time, the demo may be cancelled. This year, Previews
    and have been added to the demo area. Previews are demos
    without a corresponding event; designers
    showing their upcoming games either as an
    adjunct to anticipated Kick Starter campaigns
    or extended playtesting opportunities. Doing
    so in the Demo area allows us to relieve pressure
    on the Open Gaming area while at the
    same time benefiting everyone with scheduled
    opportunities to gather players without
    tying up tables trolling for interest.
  </item>
		<item>FORMAT: Before playing an event, check the
    Event Preview at http://www.boardgamers.org/wbc23/previews-2023.html,
    the event kiosk, or via the tournament screen in the app by selecting
    an event or searching for that tournament. The Event Preview contains
    the details about how the event will run, any
    special tournament rules, the number of players
    who qualify to advance, and any tie-breakers in
    use. Most events become SE during subsequent
    rounds. Any questions about format should be
    directed to the GM BEFORE the event begins.
    Standard tie-breakers apply to events run with
    heats. They are described on our website’s GM
    Guidelines page and in event Previews.
    \n\nFF: Free Form—Contact GM at the
    listed times for flexible scheduling.
    \n\nSE: Single Elimination—play until you
    lose one game.
    \n\nSEM: SE with Mulligan Round—the
    Mulligan is an optional Round 1 that
    forgives losses. Winners advance
    directly to Round 2. Non-winners may
    play again in the regularly scheduled
    Round 1 with no penalty.
    \n\nSWISS: Play all rounds paired against
    those with same record.
    \n\nSwEl: Swiss Elimination—play all
    preliminary rounds; qualifiers advance
    to SE rounds.
    \n\nHWO: Heat Winners Only—enter any
    number of preliminary heats; winners
    advance to next round.
    \n\nHMSE: Heats Multiple SE—each heat
    is played SE in continuous rounds to
    determine one winner who advances to
    the next round.
    \n\nHMW-T: Heats Most Wins — Timing.  Enter any
    number of heats; qualifiers advance to SE
    rounds; first tiebreaker is most wins (e.g.,
    total in all heats entered). The remaining
    tiebreakers are 2) timing of first win (first,
	second, third, fourth heat, etc.);
	3) fewest number of heats entered;
	4) most second places; 5) fewest total
	points behind first place in second place
	finishes; 6) Fewest total points behind
	first place in all finishes; 7) highest
	total points ahead of second place;
	8) high dice roll.
    \n\nHMW-P: Heats Most Wins — Points.  Enter any
    number of heats; qualifiers advance to SE
    rounds; first tiebreaker is most wins (e.g.,
    total in all heats entered). The remaining
    tiebreakers are 2) total points in all heats
	(1000 for 1st place, 100 for 2nd, 10 for 3rd, 1 for 4th);
	3) GM specific tie-breaker; 4) high dice roll.
	\n\nPreview: Non-event demonstration.

    The duration of the event in hours.
    Round lengths are rounded up to the next hour.
    Actual allowed playing time is determined by
    the GM and should always be less than the
    scheduled period.
  </item>
		<item>
    If an image of two rotating
    arrows appears in the
    Length column, the event continues immediately
    into the next round upon completion of
    a round. The only interruption is at midnight,
    when rounds continue the following morning at
    9. GMs may grant breaks between rounds of no
    more than one hour, but only if the event is on
    schedule and such breaks are applied uniformly
    for all entrants, such that each round starts and
    ends simultaneously (e.g., some players may
    not be allowed a break that allows them to trail
    the rest of the field and delay the tournament).
  </item>
		<item>
    A map—displaying a multilevel
    floorplan of Seven Springs Resort—is shown
	on every event description screen.  The room
	for the event will flash green.  Continuous
	round Events spanning multiple days start again
	the next day in the same room unless listed
	elsewhere in the schedule.
